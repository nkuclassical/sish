# sish
- Final project of CS631 Advanced Unix Programming
- Author: [yzhan14|jwang81]@stevens.edu
- Manual: www.cs.stevens.edu/~jschauma/631A/sish.1.pdf

- yzhan14 works for command parsing, prompt, pipelines, redirection
- jwang81 works for builtins, background commands, util module, project test


Addition: jwang81 pushed some code to another git repository
(https://github.com/nkuclassical/Advanced_Unix_Programming/tree/master/sish/sish
/sish), and then we thought maybe we need a independent git project, so we 
create this new repository(https://github.com/nkuclassical/sish). 

yzhan14 moved all code from old repository to the new repository, so some 
commits(2 commits/ 164++/ 9--) from jwang81 are missed.
